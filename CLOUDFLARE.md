# Cloudflare Workers (static assets) — Memofun

> **Production branch & automatic deploy.** Memofun deploys
> **automatically on every push to `main`** via the **Cloudflare
> Git connector**. The GitHub Actions workflow
> [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs
> `node scripts/check.js` on every push and PR but does **not**
> deploy. The Cloudflare dashboard is the source of truth for
> project settings.
>
> **This project is deployed as a Cloudflare Worker (static assets),
> not classic Cloudflare Pages.** Live at
> <https://memofun.miralante.workers.dev>.
>
> **Part of the Miralante suite.** Memofun is **one of the seven
> siblings** (Apptonomia, Calculia, Memofun, Okeymoney, Routime,
> Sinonimia, Teclatlon) that share the same author, the same
> accessibility-first / no-backend philosophy, and the same Cloudflare
> deploy story. The canonical group-wide guide lives in
> [Apptonomia's `CLOUDFLARE.md`](https://github.com/miralante/apptonomia/blob/master/CLOUDFLARE.md)
> (the metaproject root, this very file); the per-sibling
> `CLOUDFLARE.md` documents only the project-specific bits

## How it works

1. The repo is connected to a Cloudflare Workers project named
   `memofun` (Workers & Pages → Connect to Git).
2. Every push to `main` triggers a build in Cloudflare's
   infrastructure via Workers Builds, which reads
   [`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml) to deploy the repo root as a
   static-assets Worker (no `main` script). The
   `[build] command = "rm -rf .git"` in `wrangler.toml` runs first
   so the deploy artefact doesn't ship the git pack file (see
   "Configuration in Cloudflare" below).
3. The build is otherwise a no-op: no `output directory` other than
   `.`, so the static files are served as-is.
4. The `ci.yml` GitHub Action still runs on every push and PR
   to gate content, but it does not deploy.

[`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml) is the actual deploy configuration
Workers Builds reads — not just a convenience for local CLI use. It
pins the project name (`name = "memofun"`) and declares
`[assets] directory = "."` (no `main` script), plus
`not_found_handling = "404-page"` so Cloudflare serves this repo's
own `404.html` for an unmatched path instead of a bare empty 404.

> **Do not "fix" by deleting `wrangler.toml`** or by switching to
> the legacy `pages_build_output_dir` Pages shape. Memofun's
> Cloudflare dashboard project is already a Worker with "Workers
> Builds", and Cloudflare's own current guidance is to prefer
> Workers + static assets over classic Pages for new static sites.
> `wrangler pages deploy` and the Pages shape do not apply here —
> use `wrangler deploy` if you ever need to push from a dev
> machine.

## Files in this repository

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `_headers` | Cache and security headers |
| `wrangler.toml` | Pins the project name + the `[build] rm -rf .git` + the `[assets]` binding + `not_found_handling = "404-page"` |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Pre-deploy gate (see "CI — pre-deploy gate" below) |
| `.github/workflows/smoke-prod.yml` | Periodic smoke test against the live URL |

Every section of the site (`site/`, `tools/<slug>/`, `team/`,
`about/`, `config/`, `legal/`, `decks/`) ships its own real
`index.html`, so Cloudflare's implicit per-directory `index.html`
lookup handles deep links without any rewrite rule.

No `_redirects`, no `functions/`, no `package.json`, no Cloudflare
service-account keys.

## Configuration in Cloudflare

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Framework preset | None |
| Build command | `rm -rf .git` (declared in `wrangler.toml` `[build]`) |
| Build output directory | `.` |
| Production branch | `main` |
| Root directory | *(empty — repo root)* |

> **About the `Build command` above.** Memofun is a plain static
> site with no compile / bundle step, so the "build command" is a
> single `rm -rf .git`. Workers Builds does a `git clone` of the
> repo into the build environment, which leaves `.git/` in the
> working tree; Wrangler's `[assets] directory = "."` then lists
> every file under that tree (including the git pack file,
> ~78 MiB), and the deploy fails with "Asset too large" against
> the 25 MiB per-file limit. Removing `.git/` before Wrangler reads
> the directory fixes it without touching the repo layout, the
> schema, or any served path. See `wrangler.toml` for the inline
> comment.

No environment variables are required — the app is vanilla
HTML/CSS/JS with zero third-party dependencies, not even from a
CDN, and makes no server-side calls.

## Required Cloudflare headers

The site uses a [`_headers`](_headers) file at the repo root to set
security headers (a tight CSP with no external script/connect
hosts, plus the usual clickjacking/MIME/referrer hardening) and a
cache policy: Cloudflare reads it on every deploy automatically —
no dashboard configuration needed.

## `*.workers.dev` subdomain — Triggers

For a static-assets Worker, Cloudflare only serves requests over a
**route** (a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a custom domain). Without
one, the project deploys fine — the build succeeds, files are
uploaded, "Deployments" lists the commit — but the dashboard shows
**"No active routes"** and every URL returns empty.

**Fix — one click in the dashboard:**

1. Workers & Pages → `memofun` → **Settings** → **Triggers** (or
   **Routes**, depending on the dashboard version).
2. Under **Workers.dev subdomain**, click **Enable** (or **Add**).
   Cloudflare assigns the URL immediately; no rebuild needed.
3. If the dashboard only shows a routes table, add a route
   manually:
   - **Route pattern**: `*/*`
   - **Zone**: `workers.dev` (the account's free `*.workers.dev` zone)
   - **Worker**: `memofun`
4. Once the route is active, if the latest commit isn't already
   showing as the **Active** deployment, go to **Deployments** →
   click the most recent successful build → **Retry deployment** (or
   **Promote to deploy**).

> **Cannot be set in `wrangler.toml`.** The `workers.dev` binding is
> a per-project dashboard setting; it is not declared anywhere in
> the repo. `wrangler deploy` from the CLI does not apply here
> either — Workers Builds owns the deploy, and the dashboard owns
> the routes.

## Service worker cache

`sw.js` is **cache-first** — the same strategy used by every PWA
sibling of the suite (`calculia`, `okeymoney`, `routime`,
`sinonimia`; `teclatlon` uses network-first, and `apptonomia`
ships no SW).

- `sw.js` declares a `VERSION` string (e.g. `memofun-vN`).
- `sw.js` declares a `FILES` (or `ARCHIVOS`) array listing every file
  the SW pre-caches on install.
- A change to any file in `FILES` requires bumping `VERSION` in the
  same commit.
- `scripts/check-version-bump.js` is the CI gate that fails the
  build when a cached file changed but `VERSION` didn't.

The cost of bumping is one integer; the cost of not bumping is
"the user thinks the fix didn't land". Bump liberally rather than
conservatively. See `CLAUDE.md` §B.1 for the canonical rule.

## CI — pre-deploy gate

Every push to `main` and every PR against `main` runs
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) plus
[`.github/workflows/smoke-prod.yml`](.github/workflows/smoke-prod.yml)
(forks may override the live URL via the `PRODUCTION_URL` repo
variable),
which gate content before the Cloudflare Git connector ever sees
the commit. The CI workflow does **not** deploy — deploy is
exclusively the Cloudflare dashboard reading `wrangler.toml` and
`_headers`. No GitHub secret is required, no `wrangler login` is
needed locally.

## Custom domain

Memofun has no custom domain at the moment — it is served at the
default `*.workers.dev` URL
(<https://memofun.miralante.workers.dev>). To add one, follow
**How to add a custom domain** below.

## How to redeploy

Nothing to do. Push to `main` and Cloudflare rebuilds.

For a manual rebuild (e.g. after Cloudflare itself had an
incident), go to the Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages →
`memofun` → **Create deployment** → choose a branch or upload a
directory.

For a one-off preview outside the Git connector (e.g. to test a
dirty worktree without pushing):

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

## How to roll back

Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → `memofun` →
**Deployments**. Each successful build is listed with a timestamp.
Click any of them and select **"Retry deployment"** or **"Rollback
to this deployment"**.

## How to add a custom domain

Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → `memofun` → **Custom
domains** → **Set up a custom domain** → follow the wizard. DNS is
configured automatically if the domain is already on Cloudflare, or
by CNAME if it is on another provider.

## Rotating credentials

There are no API tokens or secrets to rotate. The GitHub
integration is a one-time OAuth authorisation; revoking it is a
matter of removing the app's access on
[github.com/settings/applications](https://github.com/settings/applications).
